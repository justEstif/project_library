# project_library

a small Library app using DOM manipulation and class
live: https://justestif.github.io/project_library/

I was able to make the library more resonsive and have also add local storage into the app. It doesn't have the change read function. I will do so in time, I think radio buttons will be a better way of doing it. 

I find the class design pattern to be a bit easier due to my past experience with Java and Python, even though the JS implementation is simple hiding the prototype.
